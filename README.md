To use the MCP server, use the configuration as below:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "default-server": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://dinaaksh2-dinotts.hf.space/mcp/sse",
      "note": "For Streamable HTTP connections, add this URL directly in your MCP Client"
    }
  }
}

# Note: Currently, the server is offline due to the model training process.
