To use the MCP server use the configuration as below:

{
    "mcpServers": {
        "default-server": {
            "type": "streamable-http",
            "url": "https://dinaaksh2-dinotts.hf.space/mcp/sse",
            "note": "For Streamable HTTP connections, add this URL directly in your MCP Client"
        }
    }
}

#Note: currently the server is offline due to model training process.
